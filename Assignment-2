1) Discuss Cloud Network 

2) Explain the working of WI-Fi and Bluetooth
Ans)
Wifi and Bluetooth
1. Wifi -Wi-Fi means "Wireless Fidelity"
Meaning:-Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices such as
computers (laptops and desktops), mobile devices (smart phones and wearables), and
other equipment (printers and video cameras) to interface with the Internet. It allows
these devices--and many more--to exchange information with one another, creating a
networks.
⦁ How does wifi works:-
A Wifi hotspot is created by installing an acess point to an internet connection.
An access point acts as a base stations.
When wifi enabled device encounters a hotspot ,the device can then connect to that network
wirelessly.
A single access point can support up to 30 users and can function within a range of 100-150
feet indoors and upto 300 feet outdoors.
⦁ Advantages:-
1. Comfortness
2. Flexible
3.Expendability
⦁ Disadvantages:-
1.Speed
2.Realibility
3.security
2.BLUETOOTH:
Meaning :-A Bluetooth is a telecommunications industry specification that describes how
mobile devices ,computers and other devices can easily communicated with each other using
a short-range wireless connection.
⦁ How does Bluetooth works:-
A Bluetooth device works by using radio waves instead of wires or cables to connect with
your cell phones,smartphones or computer.
Bluetooth is a wireless short-range communications technology standard found in millions of
products we use every day including headsets,smartphones,laptops and portable speakers.
⦁ Advantages:-
1. Bluetooth devices are wireless.
2. Inexpensive
3. Low energy consumption.
4. provides range up to 100 meters.
⦁ Disadvantages:-
1.Low bandwidth
2.Cannot work in a long distance environment
3.Battery use increased in devices

4) Differentiate between Twisted pair, Coaxial cable & fibre optics
Ans)
TYPES OF CABLE IN COMPUTER NETWORKS
1. Twisted-pair cable :-
     A twisted pair cable comprises of two separate insulated copper wires ,which are  together in a twisted pattern and running them parallel to each other. 
       This type of cable is widely used in different kinds of data and voice infrastructures.

      · Used for:-Twisted-pair cable is a type of cabling that is used for telephone communications and most modern Ethernet networks.
       A pair of wires forms a circuit that can transmit data.
       
       · Advantages- 
       1. inexpensive and readily available.
       2.flexible and light weight
       3.easy to set up and install.
       
      · Disadvantages-
       1. low bandwidth
       2.transmission limits.
       
2.Coaxial cable:-
    it is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by an insulating layer, surrounded by a conductive shielding.
    Many also have an insulating outer jacket The diagram below illustrates the construction of a typical cable. Electrical signal flows through the center conductor.


   · Used for:-Coaxial cable is used as a transmission line for radio frequency signals. Its applications include feedlines connecting radio transmitters 
    and receivers to their antennas, computer network (e.g., Ethernet) connections, digital audio (S/PDIF), and distribution of cable television signals.

    · Advantages-
   1.Higher bandwith than twisted pair.
   2.cheap to install
   3.high transmission rate
   4.higher noise immunity

   · Disadvantages-
   1.Comparatively costly
   2.security problem
   3.expensive compared to twisted pair cables.

3. Fiber optic cable:-
   A fiber-optic cable, also known as an optical-fiber cable, is an assembly similar to an electrical cable, but containing one or more optical fibers 
   that are used to carry light. The optical fiber elements are typically individually coated with plastic layers and contained in a protective tube suitable
   for the environment where the cable will be deployed. 


   · Used for:-Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiber-optic
   communications ,where they permit
    transmmision over longer distances and at higher bandwidth than electrical cables.
    
    · Advantages-
   1. Huge bandwidth
   2. flexible 
   3. faster data transmission
   
  · Disadvantages-
  1.difficult to install and modify
  2. costs more than twisted pair cable and coaxial cable
  3. it takes a higher level of training and skill to terminate fibre.
  
 Signal transmission	-
    Twisted pair -Takes place in the electrical form over the metallic conducting wires.	
    Coaxial cable -Takes place in the electrical form over the inner conductor of cable.	
    Fibre optic -Takes place in an optical form over a glass fiber.
    
Cause of power-	
    twisted pair -Power loss due to conduction and radiation.
    coaxial cable-	Power loss due to conduction.
    fibre optic-	power loss due to absorption, scattering and bending.
    
Bandwidth -
    twisted pair -Twisted pair cable has low bandwidth.	
    coaxial cable-Co-axial cable has moderately high bandwidth.	
    fibre optic -Optical fiber cable has very high bandwidth.
    
Installation -
     twisted pair -Easy installation.	
     coaxial cable -Fairy easy installation.	
     fibre optic -Difficult to install.
